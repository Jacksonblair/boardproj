	# CORE FEATURES

		Tools for board feed editing
			- Edit button
				- Pressing it shows checkboxes for every post
				- Save as... (saves as a post-link to one of your boards)
				- Delete (Should only show if user is owner of board)

# Post-links?
	+ Add a post to your board from another board.
	If the original is deleted?
		Make post-link a new type of schema in the db
		Or just add it as a post to the board? With a post_link_id, post_link_orig_author, post_link_orig_board

			What if someone updates the linked post?
				Whenever a post is updated, it should look for posts that have a post_link_id matching the post id
				... And then update those posts to match.

				...

			What if someone deletes the linked post?
				If a post is deleted, it can look for matching post links, and update them to show that the original post has been deleted.
